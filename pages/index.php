	<strong>Recently, Atheme has acquired the popular revision control tracking service, <a href="http://cia.vc" title="CIA">cia.vc</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, we don't have that much listed here on the home page, as there isn't that much to say.
	Mainly, we develop stuff, so check out the <a href="http://www.atheme.org/projects" title="Projects">projects page</a> for more information.
	Our <a href="http://confluence.atheme.org" title="Atheme Wiki">Wiki</a> also has useful information, as well as the <a href="http://jira.atheme.org" title="JIRA Bug Tracker">bug tracker</a>.
	For many development versions of the Atheme projects, check out <a href="http://git.atheme.org" title="Git">our Git repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any suggestions on how to improve the website, contact our webmaster via email, or <a href="http://webchat.staticbox.net/?channels=#atheme-project" title="#atheme-project on StaticBox IRC"><span class="italics bold">locate us on IRC via the webchat or at irc.atheme.org</span></a>.
	Alternatively, if you have an issue or a suggestion, you can open up an issue at <a href="http://jira.atheme.org/browse/WEB"><strong>at the bug tracker</strong></a> and it will be seen and taken care of promptly.
</p>
<p>
	If you're interested in tracking the development of the project's website, there is plenty of information to be found on the <a href="http://git.atheme.org/atheme.org">Git repository</a> for Atheme.org.

<p>
	Thanks.
