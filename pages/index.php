<div class="heading">Welcome</div>
<div class="subheading">We are Atheme, an open-source development collective. Questions or concerns in regard to the website? <a href="http://www.atheme.org/contact" title="Contact Us"><strong>Contact us</strong></a>.</div>

<p>
	<strong>Recently, Atheme has acquired the popular revision control tracking service, <a href="http://cia.vc">cia.vc</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, we don't have that much listed here on the home page, as there isn't that much to say.
	Mainly, we develop stuff, so check out the projects page for more information on that.
	Wiki has some information, the bug tracker is useful (not really). For the development
	versions of the Atheme projects, check out the repository linked above.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any suggestions on how to improve the website, contact our webmaster via email, or locate us on IRC at <a href="irc://irc.atheme.org/atheme-project"><span class="italics bold">irc.atheme.org</span></a>. 
	Alternatively, if you have an issue or a suggestion, you can open up an issue at <a href="http://jira.atheme.org/browse/WEB"><strong>at the bug tracker</strong></a> and it will be seen and taken care of promptly.
</p>
<p>
	If you're interested in tracking the development of the project's website, which is now apparently a subproject, head over to <a href="http://git.atheme.org/atheme.org">Git</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks.
